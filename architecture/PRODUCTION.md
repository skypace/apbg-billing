## The shape of it

```
FORMULA  (the batching sheet — percent by weight)
   │  a case is cans × oz ÷ 128 gallons; × density = lbs of liquid;
   │  × each percent = lbs of that material in ONE case
   ▼
RAW MATERIALS  (ops.raw_ingredients — one row per physical material)
   │  how it is BOUGHT: vendor, pack, cost, QuickBooks item
   ▼
BILL OF MATERIALS  (one per sellable case SKU)
   │  ingredients (from the formula) + 24 cans + 1 tray
   │  + fill charge + tolling charge          ← per case
   ▼
WORK ORDER  ("make 500 cases")
   │  batch plan: gallons needed, and how many MORE cases fill the tank
   │  materials: recipe quantity → whole vendor packs
   ▼
PURCHASE ORDERS  — ONE PER VENDOR, generated from the work order
   │  AC Calderoni  → the ingredients
   │  Quantum Canning → fill labour, pack off
   │  Craft Beverage Packaging → cans, trays
   ▼
PRODUCTION  at the co-packer: materials land → consume → record yield
   │  the yield rate is per flavour and lives on the formula
   ▼
PRODUCTION PURCHASE ORDER
   │  ONE PO to ALAMEDA SODA COMPANY PRODUCTION for the finished cases,
   │  priced at the merged per-case cost of everything above
   ▼
SHIP (BOL) back to Brix → RECEIVE into inventory → CLOSE
```

## Where each number comes from

| Question | Answered by |
|---|---|
| How much sugar is in a case? | `ops.fn_formula_case_requirements(bom_id)` |
| How many cases fill a 2 000 gal tank? | `ops.fn_batch_plan(bom_id, cases)` |
| How much do we buy for 500 cases? | `ops.fn_wo_create_pipeline` → `ops.work_order_materials` |
| Which vendor gets which PO? | the vendor on each material row; `ops.fn_wo_generate_pos` groups by it |
| What did a case actually cost? | `ops.work_order_costs.per_case`, set when the yield is recorded |
| What do we owe ourselves for the finished cases? | `ops.fn_wo_create_production_po` |

There is exactly ONE implementation of the per-case arithmetic. The BOM rebuild,
the recipe preview in the BOM editor and the work order all call
`fn_formula_case_requirements`. A second copy would drift, and the direction it
drifts in is a purchase order for the wrong quantity.

## Rules that are load-bearing

**Water is not purchased.** Filtered water is 87–99% of every formula by weight
and comes out of the wall at the co-packer. It stays on the batching sheet — it
is what makes the percentages total 100 — and is excluded from the BOM and every
PO by `raw_ingredients.is_purchased = false`. Putting it on a Calderoni PO would
order two tons of water per run.

**Recipe units are not purchase units.** The formula says lbs; the vendor sells
50-lb bags. `work_order_materials.recipe_qty` is the theoretical need and
`required_qty` is what goes on the purchase order — converted to packs and
rounded UP to a whole order multiple, because you cannot buy 0.4 of a bag.
Collapsing the two is how a PO ends up ordering 11.7 bags of sugar.

**A BOM line has an owner.** `product_bom_lines.source` is `'formula'` (written
by `fn_bom_sync_from_formula`, replaced wholesale on every rebuild) or
`'manual'` (cans, tray, fill labour, tolling — written by `fn_bom_save_v2`,
never touched by a rebuild). The BOM editor loads only manual lines into its
form and shows the recipe read-only beside them. Break that split and a rebuild
either wipes the operator's packaging lines or adds a second copy of the recipe.

**Nothing invents a cost.** A material with no price on file shows a gap, and
the per-case cost comes out short and says so. A plausible-looking number here
becomes a QuickBooks bill.

**The production PO is refused before a yield is recorded.** Until then there is
no measured per-case cost, only an estimate nobody weighed.

**A materials PO and the production PO are opposite ends of one run.**
`purchase_orders.po_kind` keeps them apart (`materials` vs `production`). Summing
them as spend double-counts the whole batch.

## The accounting

Everything settles through **Can Raw Materials** (QuickBooks account `294`),
named in `ops.production_settings.clearing_account_ref_id`:

- The AC Calderoni bill hits it.
- The Quantum Canning and Craft Beverage bills hit it.
- The bill from **ALAMEDA SODA COMPANY PRODUCTION** for the finished cases hits
  it as the offset, and puts the real cost on the finished case item.

So the account nets to zero per run, and any balance left in it is a genuine
variance you can look at rather than a rounding rumour buried in COGS.

## Tanks and yield

`product_formulas.tank_sizes_gal` (default `{1500,2000,2500}`) and
`product_formulas.yield_pct` are **per flavour** — a flavour that cannot run in
the small tank simply does not list it, and a flavour with a known loss carries
its own. `yield_pct` does two jobs: it sets how much liquid must go into the
tank for N cases, and it becomes the scrap percentage on the formula-derived BOM
lines (`scrap = (1 − yield) / yield`, so `qty × (1 + scrap)` is exactly
`qty ÷ yield`).

`yield_pct` ships at **1.0 on all seven formulas** — the honest default until a
real run measures one. Set it from the first run's actuals.

## Creating the QuickBooks items

Refractor → Production → **Raw Materials** → *Create the N missing QuickBooks
items*. It previews first and writes nothing until the second click, because a
QuickBooks item cannot be deleted once created, only made inactive.

Items are created as **non-inventory purchase items** named `RM <material>`
(SKU `RM-<SLUG>`), expensed to the clearing account. An item of the same name
that already exists is LINKED, never duplicated — a duplicate item splits an
item's purchase history in two and that is not fixable by editing.

Backed by the `qbo-raw-materials` edge function (`verify_jwt=false`, gated by the
service-role key and the shared QBO OAuth lease, same posture as every other
`qbo-*` function on this project).

## Known gaps, 2026-09-02

1. **No costs and no pack sizes.** All 17 purchased materials have both blank.
   Quantities are right; per-case cost is not computable until a Calderoni price
   list is entered on the Raw Materials tab.
2. **Six of seven BOMs have no empty-can line.** Items `685`, `686`, `688`,
   `689`, `690`, `691` are INACTIVE in QuickBooks (someone deactivated them —
   QBO appends "(deleted)" to the name); only Old Fountain's `687` is live.
   Reactivating them is a deliberate decision about whether those can designs
   are current, so it has been left to a human.
3. **Cans and trays are vendored to Craft Beverage Packaging Solutions, not
   Quantum Canning.** That is what the live BOM data says and it contradicts the
   process as described. It is not a bug in the code — PO generation groups by
   whatever vendor is on the line, so today a run produces three POs, not two.
   Change the vendor on the BOM lines if the description is the correct one.
4. **`fn_wo_advance`'s `record_yield` still values components from
   `work_order_materials`.** With pack rounding in play that is the cost of what
   was BOUGHT rather than what was CONSUMED. For a first run they are the same
   number; once pack sizes exist they will differ by the remainder of the last
   bag, which is a real cost and arguably belongs in the batch anyway.
